The JSON handling done using the 'fastJSON' library from:
  http://fastjson.codeplex.com/

Steps to install:
 - download the zip file from CodePlex.
 - extract it.
 - copy the 'fastJSON' directory into the directory *containing* the agent repo
   i.e. fastJSON and agent should both have the same parent directory.
 - open visual studio by opening the agent.csproj file or the .soln file
   if it exists.
 - in Solution Explorer (upper right hand corner some times) Right click on Solution WindowsAgent and choose "Add--->Existing Project..."
 - Selet fastJSON/FastJSON net35.csproj and open.
 - build the 'fastJSON net35' project by pressing F6.

After following the above steps once, you shouldn't have to do anything further.

The checked-in VS project refers to this project location and loads the DLL from the 'output\net35'
directory located at the same level as the fastJSON and agent directories.
