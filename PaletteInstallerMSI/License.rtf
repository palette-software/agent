\pard\keepn\hyphpar0\sa240\ul\b Exhibit A\par
Palette Agent and Services Description\par
\ulnone\b0 The Solution comprises the Services and at least one Agent. The purpose of the Solution is to monitor and manage Tableau Server environments. The Services communicate with the machines in a Tableau Server environment by way of the user-installed Agent. The Services use the Agent to monitor the user-designated machine(s) in the Tableau Server environment. The Services also use the Agent(s) to manage various functions of the Tableau Server Application. The Services generate events based on the behavior of the Tableau Server environment and report these events to the user.   \par
\ul\b\page Exhibit B\par
\pard\hyphpar0\sa240 Fees\par
Subscription Term:\ulnone\b0  After the initial Trial Term, the Solution is offered on a subscription basis, either on an Annual basis or as otherwise agreed by the parties during the initial registration process (\ldblquote Registration,\rdblquote  and such subscription term, the \ldblquote Subscription Term\rdblquote ).     \par
\ul\b Subscription Types:\ulnone\b0  \par
\i User-Based Server License: \par
\i0 If Company\rquote s Tableau Software license is designated as \ldblquote User-Based,\rdblquote  Company will be charged the applicable Subscription Fee described at [{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://kb.palette-software.com/fee-schedule"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf2 http://kb.palette-software.com/fee-schedule}}}\f0\fs22 ] (the \ldblquote Fee Schedule\rdblquote ) for each Named User (defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, \ldblquote User-Based\rdblquote  Tableau Software licenses may also be referred to in the Tableau materials as \ldblquote Web Client\rdblquote  Tableau Software licenses or \ldblquote Interactor\rdblquote  Tableau Software licenses (and may also be referred to as such in Palette Solution documentation).  A \ldblquote Named User\rdblquote  is each user the Solution identifies as being associated with Company\rquote s Tableau Software account. \par
\i Core-Based Server License: \par
\i0 If Company\rquote s Tableau Software license is designated as \ldblquote Core-Based,\rdblquote  Company will be charged the applicable Subscription Fee described on the Fee Schedule for each Utilized Core (defined below). "Core" means the processor or execution core contained in the same integrated circuit within a computer\rquote s central processing unit, whether such cores are virtual or physical; \ldblquote Utilized Core\rdblquote  means each Core which the Solution identifies as being associated with Company\rquote s Tableau Software account.\par
The rates listed on the Fee Schedule may change from time to time, provided that the prices effective for Company as of the beginning of a Subscription Term will not be modified until the Company\rquote s next Subscription Term following the implementation of such change.  Company is responsible for reviewing the Fee Schedule; please note that Fee Schedule modifications will apply to automatic renewals.\par
\ul\b Payment Method\ulnone\b0 : \par
Company will be charged in advance, to the payment method agreed by the parties upon Registration, on the day the applicable Subscription Term begins, for all subscription fees due for such Subscription Term (the applicable \ldblquote Subscription Fees\rdblquote ).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during Registration Palette has agreed to send invoices to Company, such invoices will be payable within five (5) days after the applicable invoice date. Company must keep the payment method information Palette has on file for Company current and up to date; failure to provide accurate and complete information may prevent Palette from collecting payment when due, and Palette reserves the right to suspend access to the Solution due to late payment.  Late payments will bear interest until due at the rate of 1.5% per month or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is less. All fees paid to Palette are non-refundable.\par
\ul\b Upgrades and Downgrades\ulnone :\b0  \par
Company will be charged (or invoiced) in advance based on, as applicable, the number of Named Users or Utilized Cores then existing at the time of the charge (or invoice).  Palette is able to track Company\rquote s Tableau Software usage; if, at any time during any Subscription Term, the Solution identifies that either (a) Company has more Named Users or Utilized Cores than existed at the beginning of such Subscription Term, or (b) Company has upgraded from a User-Based license to a Core-Based License, Palette will immediately charge (or invoice) Company the difference between the applicable Subscription Fees due, on a pro-rata basis, based on the amount of time then-remaining in the Subscription Term.  The next Subscription Term will be billed in advance at the then-current rates listed on the Fee Schedules.  No refunds will be granted for a decrease in the number of Named Users or Utilized Cores or for a downgrade from a Core-Based License to a User-Based License.\par
